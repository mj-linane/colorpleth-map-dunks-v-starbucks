# D3 Choropleth Map Example

This repository showcases a simple d3 choropleth map component, elegantly crafted with Svelte. It's like a visual coffee tour, mapping the ratio of Dunkin' Donuts to Starbucks locations across the states.

## Components

### ChoroplethMap.svelte

A delightful map rendering component that uses d3's geoPath, scaleLinear, and other d3 goodies to paint the states with colors based on the Dunkin' to Starbucks ratio. It's like a latte art, but for geography.

### Legend.svelte

A straightforward legend component to guide the viewers through the color-coded world of coffee locations. It's the map's barista, if you will.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the project to see the choropleth map in action. It's easier than ordering a triple-shot, half-sweet, non-fat caramel macchiato.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mj-linane/colorpleth-map-dunks-v-starbucks.git
cd colorpleth-map-dunks-v-starbucks
npm install
npm run dev
```
